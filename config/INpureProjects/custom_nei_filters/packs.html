<h1 align=center>Mod Packs</h1>
<p>Below is a list of mod packs for my server, unless otherwise stated the highest version number is the pack to download and install. I'll add a list of mods as and when I get round to it. I'll also prettify the page at the same time.</p>
<p>Please not that this pack is a private pack and as such shouldn't be shared other than with those who play on my server.</p>
<p>The Lost Ninja's Little Server Pack is a heavily modified FTB Infinity 1.41 pack.</p>
